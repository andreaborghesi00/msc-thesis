\chapter{Results}
\section{Object Detection Performance Analysis}
Present the results of the object detectors, making sure that each setup is clearly defined: architecture, backbone, training hyperparameters, eventual pretraining, etc.
For each setup we present the performance using AP and AR metrics, their inference times, and the GPU memory usage.

\section{Explainability Evaluation}
Discuss the performance of the explainability methods, comparing them based on the segmentation game, performing some statistical analysis on the results.
