\chapter{Methodology}
\section{Object Detection Architectures and Backbones}
Provide an overview of the object detection used (they're already described in the background chapter), and mention how we also experiment with different backbones.

\section{Object Detection Pipeline}
Describe the overall object detection pipeline, including the preprocessing steps, the training process, and the evaluation metrics used. I might include here curriculum learning

\section{Classification Head Extension}
Discuss the classification network, how we extracted a classification dataset from the detection dataset using the bounding boxes. 

\section{Explainability Methods}
Describe how are we using the adapted CAM methods, which layers we're targeting and an example of expected output.
Explain how we're going to compare the explainability methods using the segmentation game.
