    \caption{Qualitative comparison of CAM methods on a representative test sample (Sample 184). The model's prediction is shown in red, and the ground truth in green. The Inverse Distance Score for each explanation is displayed at the top. \textbf{(Left)} Eigen-CAM produces a clean, highly localized heatmap (Score: 0.98). \textbf{(Center)} Score-CAM's heatmap is more diffuse with scattered activations (Score: 0.74). \textbf{(Right)} SS-CAM shows some smoothing but retains much of the noise from Score-CAM (Score: 0.83)}
